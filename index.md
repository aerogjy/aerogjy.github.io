# About Me
I am an incoming Assistant Professor with [Deparment of Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) (Jan. 2023). I am currently a Postdoc Fellow with the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am a member of [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/).

I was a Postdoc researcher of [Coordinated Science Lab](https://csl.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) working on robotic manipulation for high precision assembly. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in [Aerospace Engineering](https://www.aero.psu.edu/) with a minor in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), and my B.Eng. in Aircraft Design and Engineering at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://studyatnuaa.org/).

My research goal is to advance state-of-the-art aerial autonomy by bridging the aerospace and robotic communities. My research is primarily concerned with perception and manipulation algorithms to enable high performance autonomy for aerial robots. I am enthusiastic about robotics and unmanned aerial system (UAS). I am also interested in optimization and machine learning and applying them on hardware. I love flying drones and building robots.
